# Project-4: Statistical Analysis on Factors Influencing Life Expectancy (Challenge) 
> This project is a challenge that uses data from user “KumarRajarshi” on Kaggle.com. The data itself represents the importance of increasing & improving life expectancy rates in various countries. Additionally, this project also serves as a paradigm to rule out factors that may not be a contributing to the lowering of life expectancy rates, which as a result would show factors that do. Lastly, this project serves to raise awareness on factors that negatively affect life expectancy rates, which as a result, should be dealt with immediately in order to help preserve a healthier life expectancy rate and not contribute to decreasing it. 

## Technologies 
* This project will be developed using the latest version of python 3 IDEs (Jupyter & PyCharm). 

## Setup 
* To run this file, please be sure to have the latest version of Python 3 downloaded. Afterwards, download the project and execute it. 

## Status (11/25/20)
* Created the Project 4 ReadMe file and worked on the rough draft flow chart. 
* Code has not yet been implemented. This shall be worked on around 11/26-27. 

## Update (11/26/20)
* Successfully removed missing data and columns with damaged data. The team will be working with 11 out of the 22 columns from the csv file.(Leek)  
* Data that was not missing or removed has been written to a new file called "New Life Expectancy". This will be the csv file the team works with. Code from this implementation for context will be stored inside the github.
